# SproutCore

Richer and more responsive - like Twitter, Github. But still document-based instead of application-like.

Native apps is gravitating toward the web-style. Like Apple Mac App Store (a toolbar with a Web View).

Mobile load in 10 seconds and desktop load in 1 second, so it is an embarrassment. Improve load time on mobile devices. You have 1 year to develop only.

HTML+CSS is king! Don't force people to learn your own View system.

Event-driven VS State-driven. SproutCore is very state-driven via bindings while traditional web is very event-driven.
